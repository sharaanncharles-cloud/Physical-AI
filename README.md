# **Physical AI Systems Data Collection - Case Study**



## **Executive Summary**

This project demonstrates my approach to building a **scalable data collection pipeline** for **Physical AI** systems. The case study highlights key **product management** and **data-driven decision-making** strategies, along with visual analytics and performance metrics.
Key insights include:

* **Enterprise activation funnels**
* **Data upload trends**
* **Retention metrics**
* **Data quality improvement**
* **AI model performance tracking**

## **Problem Statement**

**Physical AI** refers to AI systems built to function in real-world, dynamic environments, performing tasks such as picking, sorting, cleaning, and assembling. These systems rely on massive amounts of **egocentric data** to understand interactions, improve dexterity, and learn decision-making in varied settings.



## **SWOT Analysis**

### **Strengths**

* **Scalable Data Source**: Embedding data collection in enterprise workflows reduces cost and operational friction.
* **Task Repetition + Environmental Diversity**: High-quality data from repeated tasks across varied environments.
* **Long-Term Relationships**: Partnerships with enterprises ensure continuous data flow and long-term collaboration.

### **Weaknesses**

* **Initial Setup Complexity**: The onboarding process, including hardware kit setup and data capture protocols, can be resource-heavy.
* **Data Quality Control**: Ensuring consistent and accurate data collection across different environments with minimal manual oversight.

### **Opportunities**

* **Cross-Domain Applications**: Expand to other industries such as logistics, robotics, and hazardous materials handling.
* **AI Integration**: High-quality data will directly feed into AI model development, driving faster iterations and better performance.

### **Threats**

* **Legal and Privacy Risks**: Ensuring compliance with privacy laws while capturing data involving workers’ interactions is complex.
* **Data Consistency**: Ensuring reliable, usable data despite variations in environmental conditions (lighting, clutter, etc.).



## **Operating Model**

The strategy involves **partnering with enterprises** performing repetitive tasks across diverse environments (e.g., warehouses, kitchens). These enterprises will be equipped with **lightweight, head-mounted cameras** to capture egocentric task data during normal operations.

1. **Pilot Phase**: Begin with a pilot project to validate hardware setup, data capture quality, and operational feasibility.
2. **Scaling**: After validation, scale the data collection process to multiple enterprise partners, enabling them to self-operate.
3. **Data Handling**: Ensure **secure data transfer**, **anonymization** of sensitive information, and standardized formats for AI model training.


## **SMART Execution Goals**

* **Specific**: Partner with enterprises performing real-world manipulation tasks.
* **Measurable**: At least 4 enterprise partners with 10,000+ task-hours collected.
* **Achievable**: Pilot-first rollout using shared hardware kits.
* **Relevant**: Directly strengthens Physical AI training pipelines.
* **Time-bound**: Execute within 6–9 months.



## **Data Analysis Insights**

Based on the data collected and analyzed using **Google Analytics** and task-level data trends, we gained valuable insights that directly inform both product decisions and marketing strategy.
